# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

-I created this study guide to help organize all of the information we learned and break it down so it is easy to study.
- It solves the problem of consolidating a lot of information down into simple terms.
- I learned a lot during this prework assignment. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript.

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Usage

Each section of the study guide contains notes about the four topics we learned in the prework segment of the course. If we open DevTools in Chrome, we can see JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
